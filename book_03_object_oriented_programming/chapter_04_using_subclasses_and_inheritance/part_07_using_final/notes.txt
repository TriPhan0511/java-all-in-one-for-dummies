Java has a final keyword that serves three purposes. When you use final with a
variable, it creates a constant whose value can’t be changed after it has been initialized.
Constants are covered in Book 2, Chapter 2, so I won’t describe this use
of the final keyword more here. The other two uses of the final keyword are to
create final methods and final classes.
